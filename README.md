# Get Old Tweets Programatically
A project written in Java to get old tweets, it bypass some limitations of Twitter Official API.

## Details
Twitter Official API has the bother limitation of time constraints, you can't get older tweets than a week. Some tools provide access to older tweets but in the most of them you have to spend some money before.
I was searching other tools to do this job but I didn't found it, so after analyze how Twitter Search through browser works I understand its flow. Basically when you enter on Twitter page a scroll loader starts, if you scroll down you start to get more and more tweets, all through calls to a JSON provider. After mimic we get the best advantage of Twitter Search on browsers, it can search the deepest oldest tweets.

- **TweetManager:** A manager class to help getting tweets in Tweet Model.
